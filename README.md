Continue with an incomplete Java Swing project from class

Instructions:

Build a GUI application using Java Swing using the Seat Reservation System example in Zybooks and one of the 3 custom classes from your Midterm Project.

The app should allow the user to provide data for 5 instances of your data object.

Also, try implementing a feature to allow deleting an entry from the ArrayList.
